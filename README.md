A Comparative Analysis on the Configuration Management Tools using Quantitative and Qualitative Metrics

In this project we compare Ansible and Puppet, two similar tools used primarily in the field of Development & Operations(DevOps) in Software Engineering. These tools help in provisioning, configuration management, app deployment, continuous delivery (CD) and orchestration. In order to formulate the comparison, we rely on our observations based on several different software metrics such as usability, stability & robustness, performance, platform compatibility and maintainability.

We also take into account the data that we have gathered from various sources on the internet such as Github, StackOverflow, Technology Blogs such as HackerNews, Reddit threads and User Forums to understand the popularity, user community and their contributions to these tools. Along with all other metrics, a detailed analysis of the source codes of these tools is also performed to draw a rational conclusion from this comparison.
